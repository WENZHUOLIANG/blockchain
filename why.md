In the food supply and distribution context, digitalization of supply chains entails increased transparency throughout the system, which drives better supply chain planning, better customer service, less inventory and fewer costs. 

Here, we analyze the use of blockchain in food product supply chain digitalization, which is an emerging industry trend. One of blockchainâ€™s key predicted benefits is its ability to **keep track of every action touching a food product**. This means faster traceability when food recalls happen because a single ledger can provide management information on where a shipment has been or was contaminated. Because of this benefit, many food producers like Dole and distributers and sellers like Walmart are already collaborating with IBM to develop a blockchain for their food supply systems.
